ARL Creator is an innovative iOS application designed to provide an advanced 3D environment scanning experience using Apple’s RoomPlan API, SceneKit, and RealityKit on LiDAR-equipped devices. This app enables users to capture and reconstruct a detailed 3D model of an indoor space, which can be further analyzed and customized for various augmented reality (AR) applications.

ARL Creator is intended to serve as the setup tool for the companion app ARL Navigation, where users are localized and navigated through indoor spaces using LiDAR and Augmented Reality technologies. ARL Creator allows users to create an environment model that ARL Navigation will later use to track the user’s position and movement within closed environments.
